It is to my understanding that a form of control placed over the masses can be carried out through the quality of information which people’s bodies are processing, so over time it is an effective way to slow down the competition, by putting yourself ahead of the game, which has been widely observed, from my first-hand experience, through food contamination, once the body reaches a point where it is pure, the body becomes more susceptible to foreign bodies, which enter the host of the body, lowering the individuals immune system. A large part of the mitigation comes from one’s ability to source out clean sources of food, and suitable drinking water. As Perth goes through the winter season, there’s a noticeable influx of people who will experience flue like symptoms or comes into contact with others who are currently experiencing so. Who ever controls the information, controls the money, however obvious that may seem, greed drives the few to horde the masses of information, making it harder for the typical person to get ahead in life. However quality does exist out there, they just haven’t had the same opportunity to experience the finer things in life; to wine and dine. The state of flow is achievable, but only once you integrate the necessary refinements into your life. Which entails as follows; a proper balanced, nutritious meal plan, striving for variety but not to over do it, and along with the regular replacement of fluids. To attain the best possible brain development over time, we seek what we sow. Under ideal controlled conditions we are able to perform at an optimal level, to do the work; which means reducing time spent out in polluted areas, breathing in purified air, by creating an environment which has positive air flow. Practice builds and strengthens new neural networks, that can progressively develop over time, if proper care of the body and mind is carried out. Lowering consumption, whilst increasing productivity will not only improve the quality of life, but will allow you to reach new heights.
